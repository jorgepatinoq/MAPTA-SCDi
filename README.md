## Description:
The Spatial Conflict Dynamics indicator (SCDi) maps the temporal and spatial evolution of political violence in North and West Africa since 1997. 
The SCDi divides the region into 6 540 cells (each cell is 50 by 50 kilometres) and leverages over 57 000 violent events from the 
[Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)](https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/) across 21 countries. It is possible to classify conflict types by their intensity, 
which measures the amount of violence, and concentration which assesses how violent events are distributed spatially across a region.
