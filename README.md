# Spatial Conflict Dynamics indicator - SCDi

## Description:
The Spatial Conflict Dynamics indicator (SCDi) maps the temporal and spatial evolution of political 
violence in North and West Africa since 1997. The SCDi divides the region into 6,540 cells 
(each cell is 50 by 50 kilometres) and leverages over 57,000 violent events from the 
[Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)](https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/) 
across 21 countries. It is possible to classify conflict types by their intensity, 
which measures the amount of violence, and concentration which assesses 
how violent events are distributed spatially across a region.

The SCDi identifies four types of conflict: clustered high-intensity, 
dispersed high-intensity, clustered low-intensity and dispersed low-intensity.

The SCDi was developed by the Sahel and West Africa Club (SWAC/OECD) 
in co-operation with the University of Florida’s [Sahel Research Group](https://sahelresearch.africa.ufl.edu). 
The SCDi is used in the Security section of the SWAC's Mapping Territorial Transformations in Africa (MAPTA) web
platform (https://mapping-africa-transformations.org/security/) and provides a framework for the spatiotemporal 
analysis of violence across the West Africa region.
