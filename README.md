## Description:
The Spatial Conflict Dynamics indicator (SCDi) maps the temporal and spatial evolution of political 
violence in North and West Africa since 1997. The SCDi divides the region into 6 540 cells 
(each cell is 50 by 50 kilometres) and leverages over 57 000 violent events from the 
[Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)](https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/) 
across 21 countries. It is possible to classify conflict types by their intensity, 
which measures the amount of violence, and concentration which assesses 
how violent events are distributed spatially across a region.

The SCDi identifies four types of conflict: clustered high-intensity, 
dispersed high-intensity, clustered low-intensity and dispersed low-intensity.

The SCDi was developed by the Sahel and West Africa Club (SWAC/OECD) 
in co-operation with the University of Florida’s [Sahel Research Group](https://sahelresearch.africa.ufl.edu).
